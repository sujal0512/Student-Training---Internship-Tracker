# stit-data-science-enhancer

## Overview
The **STIT Data Science Enhancer** project is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. This project aims to streamline the process of data preprocessing, statistical analysis, model training, and result visualization, making it easier for data scientists and analysts to derive insights from their data.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the main source code for data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and visualizations.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for cleaning and preparing data.
  - **analysis.py**: Functions for performing statistical analysis.
  - **models.py**: Definitions of machine learning models and training processes.
  - **visualizations.py**: Functions for creating data visualizations.
  - **utils.py**: Utility functions used across the project.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for performing exploratory data analysis.

- **data/**: Directory for storing raw and processed data files.
  - **raw/**: Directory for raw data files.
  - **processed/**: Directory for processed data files.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stit-data-science-enhancer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the functions in `data_preprocessing.py` to load and clean your data.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Utilize the functions in `analysis.py` to perform statistical tests and summarize your data.
3. **Model Training**: Define and train your machine learning models using the classes in `models.py`.
4. **Visualizations**: Create visualizations of your data and analysis results with the functions in `visualizations.py`.
5. **Exploratory Analysis**: Use the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/` for an interactive exploratory data analysis experience.
